<h1>About TrustBase</h1>
<p class="about-lead">TrustBase is a practical privacy and trust review workspace. It analyzes policy language, observed cookie behavior, and optional AI breach context to help teams quickly understand risk signals without reading every policy line manually.</p>

<section class="about-panel">
	<h2>How TrustBase Works</h2>
	<p>When you run an audit, TrustBase fetches the policy/TOS context for the target site, scans the text for known privacy risk indicators, and compares those policy claims to observed cookies. If enabled, it also generates an AI-assisted breach snapshot based on prominent publicly reported incidents.</p>
	<p>Outputs are standardized into clear sections so results are comparable run-to-run and easier to communicate across product, legal, and security teams.</p>

	<h2>Core Functions</h2>
	<ul class="about-list">
		<li><strong>Policy Risk Analysis:</strong> Detects data collection, sharing, user-rights, retention, and ambiguity terms, then summarizes risk.</li>
		<li><strong>Cookie Compliance Audit:</strong> Evaluates observed cookie behavior against policy disclosures and consent expectations.</li>
		<li><strong>AI Breach Snapshot (Optional):</strong> Produces structured incident cards, source links, synopsis, and breach grade.</li>
		<li><strong>Final Grade Aggregation:</strong> Averages available component grades (Policy, Cookie, and optional Breach).</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section class="about-panel">
	<h2>How Grades Are Calculated</h2>
	<p>Each major component produces a letter grade from A to F. TrustBase maps those grades to points (A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0), averages the available components, then converts the average back to a final letter grade.</p>
	<p>Final risk levels are interpreted from the final letter grade: A/B = Low, C = Medium, D/F = High.</p>
